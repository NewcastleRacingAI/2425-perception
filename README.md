- camera.py can be used to control the ZED camera, capture frames, use the yolo model to get bounding boxes then get the depth from that. 
- fscoco-to-yolo.ipynb used to train yolo model on fscoco dataset

This code was not integrated into the ROS software stack in time for the competition in 24-25 but seemed promising. The ZED code was not tested on the car itself so we don't know if there would be any incompatibility issues with the ZED 1 camera vs the ZED 2 camera code.
